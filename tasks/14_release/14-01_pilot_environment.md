# TASK-14-01 — Pilot Environment

## Status

`TODO`

## Model Tier

Tier A

## Related Requirements

- SRS §21 Phase 3
- SRS §43 Deployment Profiles

## Objective

Provision an isolated pilot environment with approved dataset, monitoring, limited users and separate secrets/storage.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Provision an isolated pilot environment with approved dataset, monitoring, limited users and separate secrets/storage.

### Out of Scope

- Unrelated features from later milestones.
- Importing restricted datasets or production secrets.
- Changing approved product, religious-content or license policy outside the task scope.

## Dependencies

- EPIC-13 complete

## Expected Files

- Implementation files under the relevant `14_release` application/service/package area.
- Unit and integration tests for the new behavior.
- Configuration, migration or API contract changes required by the task.
- Documentation files listed below.

## Functional Requirements

- Implement the behavior described in this task using the approved PRD, SRS and architecture boundaries.
- Return stable, documented errors for invalid input, forbidden operations and unavailable dependencies.
- Record required version, status, actor and trace metadata so the behavior can be audited and evaluated.
- Preserve backward compatibility unless the task explicitly includes a migration or version change.

## Technical Requirements

- Use release-candidate versions and isolated environments.
- Document evidence for every release gate.

## Security Requirements

- Do not commit secrets, production data or restricted religious content.
- Enforce RBAC and audit sensitive mutations.
- Validate all external input and fail closed for security- or license-critical decisions.
- Use isolated pilot/release credentials and data.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Pilot data cannot leak into production or public datasets.
- [ ] Access is invite-only and auditable.
- [ ] Monitoring and backup are operational.

## Required Tests

### Unit and Contract Tests

- Environment isolation tests
- Access-control smoke test
- Backup smoke test

### Integration and End-to-End Tests

- Add integration or end-to-end coverage for the main success path and at least one failure path.
- Confirm permission, audit and data-visibility behavior where applicable.
- Run lint, type checks and relevant security/license scans.
