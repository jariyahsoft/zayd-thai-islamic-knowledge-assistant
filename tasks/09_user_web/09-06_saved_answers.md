Tier B

## Related Requirements

- SRS §11 User Chat

## Objective

Allow signed-in users to save/unsave answers and display source validity status.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Allow signed-in users to save/unsave answers and display source validity status.

### Out of Scope

- Unrelated features from later milestones.
- Importing restricted datasets or production secrets.
- Changing approved product, religious-content or license policy outside the task scope.

## Dependencies

- TASK-09-03

## Expected Files

- Implementation files under the relevant `09_user_web` application/service/package area.
- Unit and integration tests for the new behavior.
- Configuration, migration or API contract changes required by the task.
- Documentation files listed below.

## Functional Requirements

- Implement the behavior described in this task using the approved PRD, SRS and architecture boundaries.
- Return stable, documented errors for invalid input, forbidden operations and unavailable dependencies.
- Record required version, status, actor and trace metadata so the behavior can be audited and evaluated.
- Preserve backward compatibility unless the task explicitly includes a migration or version change.

## Technical Requirements

- Use generated API clients/contracts where available.
- Meet responsive, accessibility and safe-rendering requirements.

## Security Requirements

- Do not commit secrets, production data or restricted religious content.
- Enforce RBAC and audit sensitive mutations.
- Validate all external input and fail closed for security- or license-critical decisions.
- Sanitize rendered content and avoid leaking internal traces.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Saved records reference answers rather than duplicate source text.
- [ ] Warnings appear if citations later become invalid or suspended.

## Required Tests

### Unit and Contract Tests

- Save/unsave tests
- Invalidation display tests
- Ownership tests

### Integration and End-to-End Tests

- Add integration or end-to-end coverage for the main success path and at least one failure path.
- Confirm permission, audit and data-visibility behavior where applicable.
