## Model Tier

Tier A

## Related Requirements

- FR-FDB-006

## Objective

Provide prioritized, assignable feedback queue with filters, reviewer notes, root-cause classification and resolution.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Provide prioritized, assignable feedback queue with filters, reviewer notes, root-cause classification and resolution.

### Out of Scope

- Unrelated features from later milestones.
- Importing restricted datasets or production secrets.
- Changing approved product, religious-content or license policy outside the task scope.

## Dependencies

- TASK-11-01

## Expected Files

- Implementation files under the relevant `11_feedback` application/service/package area.
- Unit and integration tests for the new behavior.
- Configuration, migration or API contract changes required by the task.
- Documentation files listed below.

## Functional Requirements

- Implement the behavior described in this task using the approved PRD, SRS and architecture boundaries.
- Return stable, documented errors for invalid input, forbidden operations and unavailable dependencies.
- Record required version, status, actor and trace metadata so the behavior can be audited and evaluated.
- Preserve backward compatibility unless the task explicitly includes a migration or version change.

## Technical Requirements

- Maintain immutable incident history.
- Minimize personal data and support controlled redaction.

## Security Requirements

- Do not commit secrets, production data or restricted religious content.
- Enforce RBAC and audit sensitive mutations.
- Validate all external input and fail closed for security- or license-critical decisions.
- Protect incident details and reporter privacy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Severity and status transitions are consistent.
- [ ] Reviewers see required trace context under least privilege.
- [ ] Resolution records corrective actions.

## Required Tests

### Unit and Contract Tests
