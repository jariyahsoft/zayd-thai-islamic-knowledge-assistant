# TASK-08-07 — Citation Registry

## Status

`TODO`

## Model Tier

Tier S

## Related Requirements

- FR-CIT-001
- FR-CIT-010

## Objective

Create canonical citation records linked to document version and chunk/reference.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Create canonical citation records linked to document version and chunk/reference.
- Support Quran, hadith, book and generic document citation metadata plus invalidation.

### Out of Scope

- Unrelated features from later milestones.
- Importing restricted datasets or production secrets.
- Changing approved product, religious-content or license policy outside the task scope.

## Dependencies

- TASK-06-04

## Expected Files

- Implementation files under the relevant `08_orchestrator` application/service/package area.
- Unit and integration tests for the new behavior.
- Configuration, migration or API contract changes required by the task.
- Documentation files listed below.

## Functional Requirements

- Implement the behavior described in this task using the approved PRD, SRS and architecture boundaries.
- Return stable, documented errors for invalid input, forbidden operations and unavailable dependencies.
- Record required version, status, actor and trace metadata so the behavior can be audited and evaluated.
- Preserve backward compatibility unless the task explicitly includes a migration or version change.

## Technical Requirements

- Use typed provider contracts and structured outputs.
- Store only safe traces; never persist hidden chain-of-thought.
- Apply deterministic policy and verification before model judgement.

## Security Requirements

- Do not commit secrets, production data or restricted religious content.
- Enforce RBAC and audit sensitive mutations.
- Validate all external input and fail closed for security- or license-critical decisions.
- Prevent prompt injection and citation fabrication.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Citation IDs are stable and unique.
- [ ] LLM-visible citation tokens map only to registered records.
- [ ] Invalidation preserves history and downstream impact.

## Required Tests

### Unit and Contract Tests

- Canonical ID tests
- Citation type schema tests
- Invalidation propagation tests

### Integration and End-to-End Tests

- Add integration or end-to-end coverage for the main success path and at least one failure path.
- Confirm permission, audit and data-visibility behavior where applicable.
- Run lint, type checks and relevant security/license scans.
