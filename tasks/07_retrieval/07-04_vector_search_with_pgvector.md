# TASK-07-04 — Vector Search with pgvector

## Status

`TODO`

## Model Tier

Tier S

## Related Requirements

- FR-RET-004
- SRS §7.3 Database

## Objective

Implement pgvector indexing and filtered similarity search.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Implement pgvector indexing and filtered similarity search.
- Support embedding-model/version isolation and query timeout.

### Out of Scope

- Unrelated features from later milestones.
- Importing restricted datasets or production secrets.
- Changing approved product, religious-content or license policy outside the task scope.

## Dependencies

- TASK-07-02

## Expected Files

- Implementation files under the relevant `07_retrieval` application/service/package area.
- Unit and integration tests for the new behavior.
- Configuration, migration or API contract changes required by the task.
- Documentation files listed below.

## Functional Requirements

- Implement the behavior described in this task using the approved PRD, SRS and architecture boundaries.
- Return stable, documented errors for invalid input, forbidden operations and unavailable dependencies.
- Record required version, status, actor and trace metadata so the behavior can be audited and evaluated.
- Preserve backward compatibility unless the task explicitly includes a migration or version change.

## Technical Requirements

- Record retrieval configuration and model/index versions.
- Enforce status/license filters inside data-access queries, not after retrieval.

## Security Requirements

- Do not commit secrets, production data or restricted religious content.
- Enforce RBAC and audit sensitive mutations.
- Validate all external input and fail closed for security- or license-critical decisions.
- Do not allow filters to be bypassed through query expansion or provider fallback.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Search never mixes incompatible embedding spaces.
- [ ] Published/status/license filters are enforced in the query.
- [ ] Index choice and maintenance process are documented.

## Required Tests

### Unit and Contract Tests

- Similarity integration tests
- Filter enforcement tests
- Timeout/load smoke tests

### Integration and End-to-End Tests

- Add integration or end-to-end coverage for the main success path and at least one failure path.
- Confirm permission, audit and data-visibility behavior where applicable.
- Run lint, type checks and relevant security/license scans.
