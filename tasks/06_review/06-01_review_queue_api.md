# TASK-06-01 — Review Queue API

## Status

`TODO`

## Model Tier

Tier A

## Related Requirements

- FR-REV-001
- FR-REV-002

## Objective

Implement paginated review queues with filtering, assignment, claim, release and escalation.

## Scope

### In Scope

- Implement paginated review queues with filtering, assignment, claim, release and escalation.
- Enforce reviewer specialization and role permissions.

### Out of Scope

- Unrelated features from later milestones.
- Importing restricted datasets or production secrets.
- Changing approved product, religious-content or license policy outside the task scope.

## Dependencies

- EPIC-05 complete

## Expected Files

- Implementation files under the relevant `06_review` application/service/package area.
- Unit and integration tests for the new behavior.
- Configuration, migration or API contract changes required by the task.
- Documentation files listed below.

## Functional Requirements

- Implement the behavior described in this task using the approved PRD, SRS and architecture boundaries.
- Return stable, documented errors for invalid input, forbidden operations and unavailable dependencies.
- Record required version, status, actor and trace metadata so the behavior can be audited and evaluated.
- Preserve backward compatibility unless the task explicitly includes a migration or version change.

## Technical Requirements

- Use optimistic locking or equivalent concurrency control.
- Persist every decision and revision before changing publish visibility.

## Security Requirements

- Do not commit secrets, production data or restricted religious content.
- Enforce RBAC and audit sensitive mutations.
- Validate all external input and fail closed for security- or license-critical decisions.
- Prevent self-approval and unauthorized publication.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Reviewers see only authorized tasks.
- [ ] Concurrent claim operations are safe.
- [ ] Filters cover language, content type, madhhab, status, priority and due date.

## Required Tests

### Unit and Contract Tests

- Queue filter tests
- Concurrent claim test
- RBAC tests

### Integration and End-to-End Tests

- Add integration or end-to-end coverage for the main success path and at least one failure path.
- Confirm permission, audit and data-visibility behavior where applicable.
- Run lint, type checks and relevant security/license scans.
